# Tamagoyaki

[![Nightly Test](https://github.com/jumerckx/tamagoyaki/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jumerckx/tamagoyaki/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Tamagoyaki is an MLIR-based framework for encoding e-graphs directly in IR, and running equality saturation.
It builds on the [`pdl` dialect](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/PDLOps/) for rewrite pattern definitions.

## Dialects

### `equivalence` Dialect

The `equivalence` dialect provides core operations for representing and manipulating e-graphs:

- **`equivalence.graph`**: Defines a graph region—a single-block region containing unordered operations and equivalence classes
- **`equivalence.class`**: Represents an equivalence class containing a set of equivalent values
- **`equivalence.yield`**: Terminator operation for `equivalence.graph` regions

Example:

```mlir
func.func @main(%a: i32) -> (i32, i32) {
  %res = equivalence.graph -> (i32) {
    %one = arith.constant 1 : i32
    %two = arith.constant 2 : i32
    
    %mul = arith.muli %a, %two
    %shift = arith.shli %a, %one : i32
    // `a << 1` is equivalent to `a * 2`
    %result = equivalence.class %mul, %shift : i32
    
    equivalence.yield %result : i32
  }
  return %res: i32
}
```

### `ematch` Dialect

The `ematch` dialect extends the `pdl_interp` dialect to support e-matching for equality saturation. It provides pattern matching and rewriting capabilities built on the PDL (Pattern Description Language) infrastructure.

#### Passes

- **`-ematch-saturate`**: Applies pattern rewriting to the program using equality saturation. This pass takes PDL-defined patterns and repeatedly applies matching and rewriting rules until a fixed point is reached (saturation), ensuring all possible equivalent expressions are explored.

- **`-ematch-saturate-benchmark`**: Runs the equality saturation process N times for benchmarking and profiling. Each iteration clones the input IR to ensure fresh state, making it useful for performance analysis and optimization validation.

## Herbie-MLIR

The `herbie-mlir` subproject extends Tamagoyaki with floating-point expression optimization inspired by [Herbie](https://herbie.uwplse.org/). The goal is to use equality saturation with the `ematch` dialect to explore equivalent floating-point expressions and select those with improved numerical accuracy or performance characteristics.

The subproject includes the `herbie-mlir-opt` tool, which combines the `equivalence` and `ematch` dialects with specialized patterns for floating-point arithmetic transformations. This tool builds on the MLIR infrastructure and the Rival type inference framework to validate transformations.


## Building

### Prerequisites

This project uses [mlir-wheel](https://github.com/llvm/eudsl/tree/main/projects/mlir-wheel) for MLIR distribution. Install dependencies with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### CMake Configuration

Configure the build with:

```shell
cmake -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python) \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(python -m mlir_wheel --root-dir) \
  -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=$(which lit) \
  -B build \
  -S $PWD
```

> [!TIP]  
> You can also link against a local MLIR build by replacing `$(python -m mlir_wheel --root-dir)` with the path to your LLVM install directory.


### Running Tests

Build and run the test suite:

```shell
cd build
ninja check-tamagoyaki
```

## About

This project's build configuration is based on [Max Levental](https://makslevental.github.io/about/)'s [mmlir](https://github.com/makslevental/mmlir) example repository.
